## The Algorithm: Spaced Repetition
<!-- Given a list of questions with corresponding "memory values", M, starting at 1:
Take the first question in the list
Ask the question
If the answer was correct:
  Double the value of M
If the answer was wrong:
  Reset M to 1
Move the question back M places in the list -->

### Endpoints
<!-- - /api/login (for user creation)
- /api/users (to see all the users) -->
